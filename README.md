**2. Research question: What is the level of impact of tropical cyclones on the productivity of the state of Florida as measured in monetary cost and working time lost between 2000-2019?**


**3. Expected coding work to be done:**

Creation of images of notable tropical cyclones in Floridian history to visually compare the strength of each storm.
The visualization of the datasets, including but not limited to the histogram, bar chart and line chart.


**4.Possible Packages to be used:**

Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

**5.Possible Datasets to be used (at least 2):**

UN Dataset for world population centers, Hurricane Best Track Dataset, Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme Environmental Data

**6.Any considerations that need to be taken into account:**

Incomplete data: the tropical cyclone environmental data has many missing values
Inaccurate data: the margin of errors when calculating or visualizing the frequency of hurricanes and its correlation with productivity of agriculture.

**7.Expected results ( Consult instructor if you don’t have an idea):**

The amount of productivity lost has increased from 2000 to 2019 due to increasing

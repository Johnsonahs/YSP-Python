# Analyze the overall trends in hurricane strength
* Look at the VMAX (maximum wind velocity) column in the data over time
* Look at the COHC (ocean heat content) column in the data over time
* The POT (potentional intensity) column is a measure of the maximum potential wind velocity, and could be important
# Find the hurricanes that have made landfall in Florida
* Use the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE columns to find the hurricanes that have made landfall in Florida. 
* Note that Florida spans a latitude from 24.5 to 31.0 and a longitude from -87.6 to -79.8
# Analyze trends in population data and labor output in Florida
* Use the population data to analyze trends in population over time
* Pay special attention to years with more hurricanes or extreme hurricanes
